# Automation system for preparing a file for analysis

## This is an automation system. It prepares data for further analysis. With the help of this program, I prepare a file for analysis in 3 minutes instead of an hour. This has greatly increased my productivity and task completion. My company started selling perfumes twice as much.

### I work for E.N Trade as a Data Analyst. It is a company that sells perfume on Amazon. One of my tasks is: I need to analyse a file of hundreds or thousands perfumes. But before analysis I need to prepare this file: delete brands we cannot sell, leave only profitable items and etc. Previously our company did it manually, it took a lot of time and brought some inevitable mistakes. My automation system has significantly increased the productivity of the workflow.
